# Cloudflare 403 challenge — operations runbook

This bot talks to three Nado endpoints over HTTPS:

| What                | Host                                | Used by                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Gateway REST        | `gateway.{mainnet,testnet}.nado.xyz` | `venue.nado_client`, `venue.product_catalog` |
| Archive REST        | `archive.{mainnet,testnet}.nado.xyz` | `venue.nado_archive`                            |
| Archive v2 symbols  | `archive.{...}.nado.xyz/v2/symbols`  | `venue.product_catalog`                         |

When Cloudflare (Nado's edge) decides our traffic looks botty, it answers any
plain JSON request with a 403 Forbidden whose body is an HTML "Just a moment…"
interstitial. Symptoms:

```
WARNING] src.nadobro.venue.nado_client: REST returned non-JSON status=403
content_type=text/html; charset=UTF-8 body='<!DOCTYPE html>...Just a moment...'
```

Until the challenge clears, the bot has:

- Empty product catalogs (mainnet menu collapses to "Switch to mainnet"-style
  errors even when the user is already on mainnet).
- Stale portfolio snapshots.
- Strategy cycles that report success but fail to fetch market price.

## How the code defends itself

The defenses live in `core/http_session.py`:

1. **Hardened headers**: every outbound call goes through a shared
   `requests.Session` configured with browser-like `User-Agent`,
   `Accept-Language`, `Sec-Fetch-*`, `Origin: https://app.nado.xyz`, and a
   `Referer`. This is enough for Cloudflare's lightweight bot check on most
   days.
2. **CF-aware retries**: `cf_request` recognises the
   `403 + content-type:text/html` Cloudflare interstitial and retries with
   exponential backoff plus jitter (default `0.5s, 1.0s, 2.0s` ±`0.4s`).
3. **Per-host circuit breaker**: after 8 challenges within a 10s window the
   circuit opens for 30s. Subsequent calls short-circuit to `None`; callers
   serve from `_spot_catalog_cache` / `_catalog_cache` via the stale-TTL
   path (`NADO_PRODUCT_CATALOG_STALE_TTL_SECONDS`, default 86400s / 24h).
4. **Throttled logs**: only one Cloudflare-warning line per host per minute
   (was: hundreds per second).
5. **Unified gateway budget** (`venue/gateway_budget.py`): every Nado REST/SDK
   call passes through host + per-user token buckets and an in-flight cap.
   Nado `error_code=1000` opens a host rate-limit circuit (default 60s cooldown).
   Callers **must skip** and serve cache when `try_acquire` returns false — never
   fan out to per-product fallbacks.
6. **WS-first portfolio** (when `NADO_PORTFOLIO_WS=true`): healthy WebSocket
   connections skip REST poll ticks; full reconcile runs every
   `NADO_WS_RECONCILE_SECONDS` (default 300s).

## What to do when you see the storm in logs

1. Check `core.http_session.breaker_snapshot()` (or grep
   `Cloudflare circuit OPEN`). If the breaker is open, the bot is correctly
   self-throttling; users keep seeing the *previous* catalog instead of an
   empty list. No action required on the bot side.
2. If the breaker is stuck open for >5 minutes, escalate to the Nado team
   using the templated message below.

## `ip_read_only` / `ip_query_only` is a GEO-BLOCK — egress must be in an allowed country

> ⚠️ **Do not commit real IP addresses to this repo.** Keep actual egress IPs in
> the Fly dashboard / secrets store / private ops channel. The commands below
> regenerate them on demand.

**Root cause of strategy orders failing with `{"reason":"ip_read_only","blocked":true}`:**
Nado rejects *writes* (place/cancel order — reads are unaffected) from any IP
that **geolocates to a restricted territory** (US, CA, and others). See the list:
<https://docs.nado.xyz/legal/restricted-territories>. This is a legal/compliance
block — it is **not** rate limiting (raising the per-IP limit does nothing) and
**not** a 1CT signer problem (the linked signer reads `verified=True` throughout).

**The trap — Fly region ≠ egress IP geolocation.** A machine in `ams`
(Amsterdam) can still be assigned a **US-registered** egress IP from Fly's pool
(AS40509 skews US). Example seen in prod: an `ams` machine egressed via a Fly IP
that geolocated to **Colorado, US** → every order blocked. So you must verify the
**geolocation of the actual IP**, not the region.

### Procedure: obtain an allowed-country egress IP

```bash
# 1. Allocate a dedicated static egress IP (per machine/region):
fly ips allocate-egress -a <app-name> -r <region>

# 2. List allocations (look for Type: egress):
fly ips list -a <app-name>

# 3. VERIFY THE COUNTRY Nado sees — this is the check that matters, not the IP:
fly ssh console -a <app-name> -C "curl -4 -s https://ipinfo.io/country"          # from inside the machine
curl -s https://ipinfo.io/<egress-ip>/country                                     # for a specific allocated IP
# cross-check org/region too:
curl -s https://ipinfo.io/<egress-ip>/json
```

- If the country is **NOT** on the restricted list (e.g. `NL`, `JP`, `SG`) →
  done. Confirm with Nado, then writes should succeed.
- If it geolocates to **US/CA/restricted** → release it
  (`fly ips release <egress-ip> -a <app-name>`) and try another region, or
  **open a Fly support ticket asking for an egress IP that geolocates to a
  specific allowed country** (Fly's pool is US-heavy, so a clean NL/JP IP may
  need their help, or a different provider/proxy — see fallback below).

**Re-verify the country after every redeploy / egress change** (Machine
recreation can drop or change the allocation). Bake a geo-check into the release
process so a redeploy can't silently land back on a US IP.

Set `NADO_FORCE_IPV4=1` (default in `fly.toml`) so Nado REST/SDK traffic uses
the static IPv4 egress rather than IPv6 when the destination publishes AAAA
records.

### Fallback if Fly can't provide an allowed-geo egress

Route Nado traffic through a proxy / small VPS in an allowed country (NL/JP)
whose IP verifiably geolocates correctly. This requires adding egress-proxy
support to the bot (SDK engine/indexer/trigger sessions + the pooled
`http_session.SESSION` + the WS connect) — not yet implemented. Track as a
follow-up if the Fly-native path doesn't yield a clean IP.

> Compliance: this is only legitimate when correcting a **misclassification**
> (you operate from a non-restricted country and the IP was mislabeled) — not to
> serve users actually located in restricted territories. Get sign-off from
> whoever owns compliance.

## Why the previous reproducer showed "Switch to mainnet"

The old menu literal was hardcoded. When Cloudflare blocked the v2 symbols
fetch, `list_volume_spot_product_names("mainnet")` collapsed to an empty list
and the menu rendered `"Switch to mainnet"` to a user who was already on
mainnet. This module now serves the stale catalog so the menu keeps working,
and the menu copy now distinguishes "no pairs listed on $network" vs
"catalog temporarily unavailable on $network" so users get accurate guidance.
