"""Dynamic Grid controller — switches GRID <-> RGRID by volatility regime.

Each tick it classifies the market with the tunable variance-ratio routine
(``variance_regime``, driven by the user's ``dgrid_*`` settings) and runs the
matching executor — a long :class:`GridExecutor` in ranges / uptrends, a short
:class:`ReverseGridExecutor` in downtrends.

Mid-flight flip (2026-06 fix)
=============================
Previously the controller classified the regime ONLY when no executor was
active and then returned early ("no mid-flight swap"). A market-making grid
never terminates under normal operation, so the regime was frozen at first
spawn and a long grid rode straight into a downtrend — the loss this fixes.

Now, on a CONFIRMED phase change (debounced by ``dgrid_flip_confirm_ticks``),
the controller flips **directional**: it stops the live grid — which closes the
open position with a reduce-only market order (``GridExecutor._stop_out``,
``keep_position=False``) — and spawns the opposite-side grid against a fresh
mid. A ``reset_threshold_bp`` re-centers the grid in place once price has
travelled that far from the spawn anchor, even without a phase change.

``NO_ORDERS_AUDIT-FIX-R4``: before spawning, bounds are rebuilt against the
current mid and the chosen side via ``step_pct`` / ``levels_count``.
