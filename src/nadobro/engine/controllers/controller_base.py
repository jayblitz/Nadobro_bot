"""Controller base — long-running strategy with on_start / on_tick / on_stop.

A controller owns a stable ``id`` (used to filter the orchestrator's executor
pool), splits its parameters into **configs** (strategy knobs) and **limits**
(``RiskLimits`` consumed by the Risk Engine), and spawns Executors via the
orchestrator. Lifecycle state (CREATED → ACTIVE → STOPPED/FAILED) is driven by
the orchestrator's spawn/stop/tick methods.

Implemented in Phase 4.
