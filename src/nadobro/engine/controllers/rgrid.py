"""Reverse Grid (R-Grid) — its own market-making strategy.

R-Grid is NOT a grid variant and NOT a phase switcher (that is D-Grid). Grid says
"don't buy above where I sold, don't sell below where I bought", which works in a
range and gets stuck when price trends out of it. R-Grid inverts that so a trend
pays:

    anchor = (buy exposure price + sell exposure price) / 2

    buy  trigger = anchor x (1 + spread)   → acts as price RISES above it
    sell trigger = anchor x (1 - spread)   → acts as price FALLS below it

Both legs reference the MIDPOINT between where the book has bought and where it
has sold — unlike grid, which mirrors the opposite leg's price directly. Each
leg's *exposure price* is a rolling VWAP over the most recent portion of that
leg's filled volume (``vwap_volume_fraction``, driven by the user's discretion
knob), which is a steadier reference than a single last fill.

Both legs are POST-ONLY limit orders (:class:`RGridMakerExecutor`) — the standing
rule for every market-making strategy here is maker-first limit orders, and this
geometry is maker by construction. A bid parked ABOVE the anchor becomes fillable
exactly once price has risen past it, because only then is it a resting bid BELOW
market that a seller can hit; symmetrically for the ask. So the fill IS the
momentum signal without paying the spread. At most one leg is postable at a time
(the two conditions are mutually exclusive); inside the band R-Grid waits.

The ONE order that crosses is the armed trailing stop. It has to act once price has
come back THROUGH the trailed level, which is precisely where a post-only order
cannot sit — so it is exempted, deliberately and narrowly: MARKET, reduce-only, and
enforced as such in the executor constructor.

Safety, in layers:

* **Session SL / TP** — % of margin on live PnL including uPnL, judged net of
  fees. Owned by ``strategy/bot_runtime._evaluate_session_pnl_rail``; this
  controller never second-guesses it, and never applies the same user number as a
  price barrier too (the units invariant).
* **Soft reset** — once price has moved favourably by ``reset_threshold_pct`` AND
  the position is in profit, the opposite (exit) leg starts FOLLOWING the trend:
  the exit leg is RE-QUOTED to follow the trend instead of resting at the anchor.
  Two exits, cheapest first: while the trailed price is still postable the exit
  leg rests there and books the pullback without paying the spread. Once price
  comes back THROUGH the trailed level — where a post-only ask cannot sit — the
  stop CROSSES to close the whole position. That crossing order is the single
  exemption from maker-only in this strategy, and it is reduce-only.
* **Reversal recalibration** — the reducing leg always rests the WHOLE position,
  so a turn books all of it in one fill rather than a step per tick while the move
  runs. Once flat the window clears and the next move picks the side.
* **Net-exposure cap** — inherited from MarketMakingController, and never
  disabled. The regime gate ships OFF (it pauses on TRENDS, which is when R-Grid
  must act); the cap, the soft reset and the session rails are the backstops.

R-Grid is never STOOD DOWN by the financial overlay
(``overlay_actuator.NEVER_SUPPRESSED``). Pausing a trend follower in a trend is
backwards, and pausing it mid-position is worse — nobody is left managing the
exit. The overlay protects it two other ways instead: it shades size and trigger
width through the mapped config, and a regime read that CONTRADICTS the open
position arms the trailing exit as soon as the position is in profit, rather than
waiting for the full threshold. Both reduce risk without abandoning the book.
