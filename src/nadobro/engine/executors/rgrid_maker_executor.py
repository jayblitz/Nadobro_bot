"""R-Grid maker executor — the only way Reverse Grid touches the venue.

Reverse Grid rests POST-ONLY limit orders, like every other market-making
strategy here (the standing rule: maker-first limit orders for all strategy opens
and closes). Its geometry is what makes it momentum rather than mean reversion:

    buy  leg rests at  anchor x (1 + spread)
    sell leg rests at  anchor x (1 - spread)

which is the mirror of Grid (bid below / ask above). Read against the spec —
"buy orders are placed at a price equal to or above the average ... they only
fill when the market price rises above this buy limit price" — a bid parked ABOVE
the anchor becomes fillable exactly once price has risen past it, because only
then is it a resting bid BELOW market that a seller can hit. So the order is a
maker order and the fill is a momentum fill: the book buys into strength on a
pullback and sells into weakness on a bounce.

The consequence of the geometry is that at most ONE leg is postable at a time.
``anchor x (1+spread) < mid`` and ``anchor x (1-spread) > mid`` cannot both hold.
Inside the band neither leg is postable and R-Grid waits — it never crosses to
force a fill.

This executor exists to make maker-only structural rather than conventional:
``ExecutionStrategy.LIMIT_MAKER`` is enforced in the constructor, so an edit that
hands R-Grid a MARKET config raises instead of quietly turning a maker strategy
into one that pays ~4.3bp per side.
