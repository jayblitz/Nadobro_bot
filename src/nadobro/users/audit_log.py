"""Append-only security audit trail for sensitive user actions.

Records to the ``audit_logs`` table (see ``db.init_db``). This is intentionally
fail-soft: an audit write must NEVER break the action it's recording, so every
helper swallows DB errors (and the failure is logged). Details strings pass
through the same log-redaction used elsewhere so we never persist a raw key,
token, or address into the audit row.

Sensitive events currently recorded:
  - wallet_linked / wallet_unlinked        (key lifecycle)
  - order_placed                           (every signed order; agent + manual)
  - howl_suggestion_rejected               (blocked unsafe auto-tuning)
  - agent_enabled / agent_disabled         (autonomous execution toggles)
