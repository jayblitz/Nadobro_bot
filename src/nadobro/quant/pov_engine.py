"""Percent-of-Volume (POV) participation engine.

Maps a target notional and a participation preset (Aggressive / Normal /
Passive) to a duration / cycle cadence / per-cycle notional, using the pair's
rolling 24h volume from the Nado archive ``/market_snapshots`` endpoint.

Multipliers are per-minute participation rates against the pair's 24h volume.
Higher multipliers complete a target faster; lower multipliers stretch it across
more cycles.

One formula, one answer
=======================
``cycle_notional_usd`` is what the BOT actually places each cycle, and both the
pre-trade card and the live sizing path go through it. They used to disagree:
the card rendered ``compute_pov_duration``'s ``notional / cycles`` over a
``60 / multiplier`` second cycle — a cadence the bot never ran — while the live
path used the cadence-correct ``rate x volume_per_minute x cycle_minutes``. On a
$10M-volume pair the card promised "$4,900 every 1200s" against a real $347
every 60s.
