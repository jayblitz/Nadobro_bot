"""Nado WebSocket v2 ACTION socket (`/ws/v2`).

This is the concurrent-dispatch executes/queries socket described at
https://docs.nado.xyz/developer-resources/api/gateway/websocket-v2 — it is NOT
the subscriptions socket (that is `nado_ws.py` / `/v1/subscribe`).

Why v2 for market making
------------------------
On a v1 connection the gateway processes requests strictly serially, so a taker
order sitting in its per-request send-rate guard blocks every post-only order
queued behind it on the same connection. v2 dispatches each request to the
engine in the background, so a post-only order sent right after a taker order
reaches the engine first. This lets a single connection carry mixed post-only +
taker flow without the post-only stream being penalised — removing the need to
segregate post-only and taker onto separate connections.

The catch: v2 responses arrive OUT OF ORDER. We therefore attach a unique
`id` to every supported execute and resolve the matching in-flight future by
that id. Per the docs, only `place_order`, `cancel_orders` and
`cancel_product_orders` echo `id` back; anything else (queries,
`cancel_and_place`, low-frequency executes) must be correlated by response
data or kept single-flight on a dedicated connection — so we deliberately only
expose the three id-correlatable hot-path executes here.

Payloads, EIP-712 signing and response shapes are IDENTICAL to v1 — only the URL
and the out-of-order correlation differ. The signed order body (sender,
priceX18, amount, expiration, nonce — including the low-20-bit client tag —,
appendix, signature) is still built by `nado_client`; this transport only
frames it, attaches the correlation `id`, sends it, and resolves by `id`.

Gated behind `NADO_WS_V2_ENABLED` (default off). REST / v1 remain the fallback
until this is validated on testnet.

Rate limits, authentication, subscriptions and the indexer are unchanged on v2.
A wallet may keep at most 5 authenticated websocket connections open, so size
any connection pool built on top of this with that ceiling in mind.
