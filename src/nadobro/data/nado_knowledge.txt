# NADO DEX - Complete Knowledge Base

## OVERVIEW
Nado is the central-limit orderbook DEX where raw power collides with surgical precision. Trade spot and perpetuals via unified margin, where kinetic collateral dynamically flows across positions — netting risks in real-time for superior capital efficiency. Built on Ink L2 and backed by the team that brought you Kraken.

## MISSION
Born from the battle-tested fires of Kraken and the Ink Foundation, Nado rejects the chaos of fragmented DEXs. They engineer the world's most performant DEX: a powerful orderbook fusing blistering speeds with perpetual and spot markets anchored by cross-margin efficiency. Their mission: hand traders the reins to tame DeFi's turbulence.

## ARCHITECTURE
Nado's architecture integrates spot, perpetuals, and money markets into one risk-calibrated engine. Two interlocking pillars:

1. On-Chain Clearinghouse: Protocol-level risk engine on Ink L2 that computes exposures, collaterals, and offsets in real-time. Oracle feeds pulse sub-second. Orders batched and submitted on-chain, starving MEV opportunities.

2. Off-Chain Sequencer (CLOB): Matches orders in 5-15ms, then batches for on-chain settlement. Central-limit orderbook accepting limit orders via frontend or HFT-optimized API. Holds no custody - assets stay locked in on-chain smart contracts. Cannot censor trades or forge signatures.

## PRODUCTS

### Spot Trading
- Deposit supported collaterals (USDT0, wETH) into unified account
- Up to 5x leverage on spot positions
- All deposits earn automatic native yields from platform fees and lending
- Unified liquidity across products - spot holdings offset risks in perpetuals

### Perpetual Trading
- Go long or short on BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP with up to 20x leverage
- USDT0 settlement
- Positions funded through unified margin system
- Basis trading streamlined: open spot-perp pair directly to capture convergence
- MEV protections and oracle-based pricing

### Money Markets
- Lenders supply USDT0 or wETH, earn proportional share of borrower interest
- Borrowers access spot collateral-backed loans at dynamic rates
- All loans overcollateralized via smart contracts
- Unified margin nets exposures - healthy positions cover borrows
- Dynamic interest rate model recalculates every 15 minutes based on utilization ratio

### NLP (Nado Liquidity Provider)
- Deposit USDT0 into NLP vault for passive yields
- Transforms idle USDT0 into active liquidity for perpetual markets
- Sub-vault strategies include liquidations and market-making
- Yields from unrealized PnL in perpetual positions
- 4-day lock post-mint, withdrawal fee: 1 USDT0 + max(1 USDT0, 10 bps)
- Capped at 20,000 USDT0 per account during Private Alpha
- Pool 0 cannot be liquidated even in unhealthy state
- Variable yields shaped by market dynamics

## MARGIN TYPES

### Unified (Cross) Margin (Default)
- Treats entire account as single collateral pool across spot, perps, money markets
- Automatic netting & rebalancing - positive PnL offsets losses
- Leverage selector acts as front-end sizing control, not margin allocation
- Risk engine evaluates account holistically
- Ideal for diversified portfolios, basis trades, multi-asset hedges

### Isolated Margin
- Dedicates fixed collateral to single perpetual position
- Only for perpetuals, one isolated position per market
- Independent liquidation threshold
- Useful for high-volatility trades, strict risk limits per position
- Can adjust margin on open positions by adding/removing

## SUBACCOUNTS & HEALTH
- Up to 4 subaccounts per wallet (frontend), unlimited via API
- Named: default, default_1, default_2, default_3
- Each subaccount operates autonomously with own balances, positions, margin
- Transfers between subaccounts: $1 USDT0 (standard), $0.10 (isolated)

### Health System
- Health = weighted measure of account stability
- Two thresholds: Maintenance Health (liquidation buffer) and Initial Health (available collateral for new positions)
- Weights adjust for asset volatility (stable assets get higher weights)
- Spreads (offsetting positions) recognized as hedges, boosting health
- Leverage = 1 / (1 - initial_asset_weight). BTC with 0.9 weight = 10x max leverage

## ORDER TYPES
- Market Order: immediate execution at best price
- Limit Order: buy/sell at specific price, maker fee rebates
- Stop Market Order: triggers market order at stop price (stop-loss, breakouts)
- Stop Limit Order: triggers limit order at stop price
- TWAP: slices large order into chunks over time duration
- Take-Profit / Stop-Loss (TP/SL): trigger orders at target prices, can chain to entry orders
- Scaled Orders: ladder of limit orders across price range, customizable distribution

### Trigger Orders
- Stop, TP/SL, TWAP are trigger orders monitored by trigger service
- Price trigger types: Oracle Price, Last Price, Mid Price
- Dependent orders (order chaining): TP/SL activates only after entry fills

### Speed Bump
- 30ms speed bump on non-post-only orders to protect liquidity providers
- Post-only orders exempt (zero added latency)

## LIQUIDATIONS
- Triggered when maintenance health < 0
- Uses oracle price from Chaos Oracle network (time-weighted average)
- Sequence: 1) Cancel open orders, 2) Liquidate assets, 3) Liquidate liabilities
- NLP may front-run external liquidators for perpetual positions
- Insurance fund: 50% of liquidation profits, absorbs bad debt
- If fund depleted: socialization in tiers (perpetual holders, then USDT0 depositors)

### Maintenance Margin Usage
- 0-40%: Low Risk
- 40-70%: Medium Risk  
- 70-90%: High Risk
- 90-100%: Extreme Risk
- 100%: Eligible for liquidation

## PNL SETTLEMENTS
- Continuous realization of profits/losses from open positions
- Unsettled USDT0: pending transfers; Settled USDT0: realized in balance
- Total PnL = Unsettled + Settled
- Account Value = Assets - Borrows ± Unsettled USDT0
- Closing positions: remaining unsettled settles automatically within minutes
- Negative PnL without USDT0: auto-borrows from money markets

## INTEREST RATES
- Kinked interest rate model based on utilization ratio
- Utilization = Total Borrows / Total Deposits
- Below kink (~80%): gradual rate increase
- Above kink: rates accelerate rapidly
- Protocol fee: 20% on interest payments
- Borrow Rate = Floor + Small Cap × (Utilization / Inflection) below kink
- Deposit Rate = Utilization × Borrow Rate × (1 - 0.20)
- Interest compounds continuously
- Rates are per-asset (USDT0 vs kBTC have different configs)

## FEES
- Taker fees as low as 1.5 bps (0.015%)
- Maker rebates up to -0.8 bps (-0.008%)
- Volume-based fee tiers
- NFT holders (Templars of the Storm) get automatic fee tier benefits

## NFT - TEMPLARS OF THE STORM
- Collection of 1,200 NFTs (1,000 to users, 150 reserved, 50 team)
- Three Wind Force tiers with points multipliers
- Fee tier benefits based on Wind Force level
- Tradeable on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/templars-of-the-storm
- Long-term identity layer within Nado ecosystem

## DEVELOPER RESOURCES

### Getting Started
- No API keys needed - wallet-based authentication via EIP-712 signatures
- SDKs: Python (nado-protocol), TypeScript, Rust (nado-sdk)
- Subaccounts use bytes32 format: wallet address (20 bytes) + name (12 bytes)
- Linked signers for delegation (1-Click Trading)

### Testnet
- Network: Ink Sepolia (Chain ID: 763373)
- Gateway WebSocket: wss://gateway.test.nado.xyz/v1/ws
- Gateway REST: https://gateway.test.nado.xyz/v1
- Faucet: https://testnet.nado.xyz/portfolio/faucet
- ETH Faucet: https://docs.inkonchain.com/tools/faucets
- Minimum deposit: $5 USDT0

### Mainnet
- Network: Ink (Chain ID: 57073)
- Gateway: gateway.prod.nado.xyz

### API
- WebSocket: JSON payloads at GATEWAY_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT
- REST: POST /execute, GET/POST /query
- Must set Accept-Encoding to gzip, br, or deflate
- Ping frames every 30s to keep WebSocket alive

### Common Errors
- Error 2028 "Signature does not match": Wrong private key, wrong chain ID, wrong verifying contract, or wrong data types
- Error 2024 "No previous deposits": Subaccount doesn't exist, need deposit >= $5 USDT0
- 1-Click Trading broken: linked signer mismatch after API integration

### Quickstart Steps
1. Install SDK: pip install nado-protocol
2. Create client: create_nado_client(NadoClientMode.TESTNET, PRIVATE_KEY)
3. Deposit >= $5 USDT0 (creates subaccount)
4. Place order using PlaceOrderParams
5. Verify with get_subaccount_open_orders

## SUPPORTED MARKETS

Spot: wETH, USDT0, kBTC

## BLOCKCHAIN
- Built on Ink L2 (by Kraken)
- EVM-compatible
