"""Executable SL/TP & strategy-config invariants — the self-review guardrails.

This file is the machine-checkable expression of the 2026-06-20 strategy audit
(``docs/audit/STRATEGY_SLTP_AUDIT_2026-06-20.md``). Each test encodes ONE
invariant the trading strategies must satisfy so a user's configured SL/TP and
sizing are actually honored and the bot does not bleed money.

Two kinds of tests live here:

* **Green invariants** — properties that hold today. They guard against
  regression (e.g. the rgrid/dgrid SL/TP key resolution that was already fixed).
* **xfail invariants** — known-broken properties from the audit, marked
  ``@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)`` with the audit ID in the reason. When the
  underlying bug is fixed the test XPASSes and ``strict=True`` turns that into a
  CI failure — your signal to delete the xfail marker and lock the fix in.

Run just these::

    python -m pytest tests/engine/test_sltp_invariants.py -v

No DB or network required — these exercise pure config/resolution logic.
