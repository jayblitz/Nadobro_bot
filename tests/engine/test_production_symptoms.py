    The engine hold recorded buy 0.00155 / sell 0.00155 — it NETS FLAT — so the
    controller cannot prove that balance is its own.

    Audit round 4 established that auto-selling it is NOT acceptable: the rule that
    did so (max of venue/book, capped at GROSS buys) also market-sold balances the
    user held for their own reasons, and oscillated sell/buy forever because the
    sweep's own fills moved the book.

    it CANNOT is reported to the user and left alone, and the account is refused a
    new hedge while it is non-flat. The user is never silently naked, and we never
    dispose of coins we cannot prove we bought.
