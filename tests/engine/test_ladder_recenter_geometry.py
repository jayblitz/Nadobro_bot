"""RGRID-STALE-LADDER — the re-center threshold must be bounded by the ladder.

Reported 2026-07-28: "the bot just places orders and does not quote again until
the market comes and picks the order". Investigated on production (Fly, app
nadobro-bot) against RGRID session 165 (user 5776741680, BTC-PERP, mainnet,
06:28 -> 13:32 UTC, stopped by session SL):

    total_cycles            2080        <- one tick every ~12s for 7 hours
    total_orders_placed       26        <- one order every ~16 minutes
    zero_order_cycles       2063        <- 99.2% of cycles placed nothing
    levels                     3
    spread_bp               10.0        -> ladder band = 10 x (3-1) = 20bp
    dgrid_reset_threshold_bp  80.0      <- 4x the band it is supposed to track
    dgrid_realized_move_bp   17.83      <- never got close to firing

The fills prove the ladder froze: the SAME maker price
(63352.4017854148, to ten decimal places) was re-issued from 09:58 to 13:27 —
three and a half hours — with gaps of 83, 39 and 126 minutes between fills.
BTC's ENTIRE range over the session was 63189 -> 63502 = 49bp, so
``realized_move_bp >= 80`` was arithmetically unreachable: the grid could not
re-center once, by construction.

Root cause: ``rgrid_reset_threshold_pct`` is a percent of PRICE (registry
default 1.0%; UI presets 0.8% / 1.5%) mapped straight to
``dgrid_reset_threshold_bp``, and the controller then applied it as
``max(user, 12bp, band/2)`` — a one-sided FLOOR. Nothing related the threshold
to the width of the ladder it steers, and ``_recycle_completed_levels`` re-arms
a round-tripped level at its ORIGINAL price, so the re-center is the ONLY thing
that ever moves a ladder toward price.
