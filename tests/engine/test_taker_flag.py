"""``is_taker`` on recorded fills — RG-TAKERFLAG-1 (self-review 2026-08-07).

The venue reports NO per-fill maker/taker flag on the path the engine uses: the
SDK's ``IndexerMatch`` model carries only base/quote/fee (+ digest/order/
timestamp), so ``NadoClient.get_matches`` cannot answer it. (``venue/
nado_archive`` reads an ``is_taker`` key defensively off the RAW archive HTTP
shape, which the adapter does not use.) So ``Executor._fill_was_taker`` resolves
it in three tiers, and these tests pin each one.

This flag is REPORTING ONLY — the ``trades_<network>.is_taker`` column and the
History/trade_service views. Fees are the venue's own (``fill.fee_quote``, split
into builder_fee + fill_fee by engine_persistence), so a wrong flag never
mis-prices a fill. Before this it was derived from the REQUESTED
``execution_strategy is MARKET``, which recorded three genuinely-crossing cases
as maker: the volume bot's marketable limits, the adapter's dust-exit rewrite,
and grid's reduce-only MARKET flatten (whose config has no execution_strategy
at all).
